            Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful 
            light lunch. Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a little oil,
            and topped with two eggs. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>8 thin-stemmed aspargus stalks, trimmed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        </ul>
                
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
                Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and
                garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
                Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus
                often to ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes. 
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
                Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus.
                Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk
                is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes.
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
                Season with salt and pepper; 
                sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve immediately.
