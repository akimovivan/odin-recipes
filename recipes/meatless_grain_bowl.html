            This meatless grain bowl is made with tofu "jerked" to perfection.

        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white rice</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 large sweet potato, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil or vegetable oil, or as needed, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 orange bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) package extra firm tofu</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon jerk seasoning, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons jerk marinade</li>
        </ul>
                
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to 
            medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water
            has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Keep warm.  
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).  
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            Toss cubed sweet potatoes in 1 tablespoon oil. Spread evenly on a baking sheet.
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            Roast sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until tender but 
            not too soft, 15 to 20 minutes. 
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            Heat a cast iron skillet with 1 tablespoon coconut oil over 
            medium-high heat; add red, green, and orange bell peppers 
            and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside. 
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            Add remaining 1 tablespoon coconut oil to the same skillet.
            Add tofu evenly. Cook for 2 minutes and gently flip to the other
            side. Continue cooking, turning occasionally, until tofu gets
            a little crisp on the edges, 6 to 8 minutes.
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            Add jerk marinade, being deliberate about making sure tofu is
            covered. Once tofu starts to caramelize from the marinade, remove from heat. 
            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            Warm black beans in a microwave-safe dish until hot, 2 to 3 minutes,
            stirring every 30 seconds. 
            <h3>Step 9</h3>
            Assemble grain bowls: divide rice, tofu, peppers, sweet potatoes,
            and black beans evenly into individual serving bowls.
